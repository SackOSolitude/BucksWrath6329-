### importing Github Projects into Eclipse workspace ---  
##### Easy way -`recommended`-
1. hit clone/download button on the repository page  and download ZIP file
2. "unzip" or extract file and place somewhere you can remember such as on your desktop 
3. Then open Eclipse and right click within package explorer
4. click on import and open file *general* then use *File System*
5. click on Browse... and find where you put the downloaded file and click on it and hit *Ok*
6. check the white box on the left side of the file name you are importing
7. click *finish* and you're done!
##### second way- clone link-
1. click Clone/download button on the repository page and a link will pop up, copy that
2. then go into Eclipse and right click on an empty part of the package explore
3. click import
4. left click on the folder *Git* then double click *projects from git*  
5. double click *clone URL*
6. paste the copied URL into the box to the right of *URL:* - the other boxes shall auto fill dont worry!-
7. enter username and password in the bottom part under *Authentication* 
8. Click *finish* 
9. Click file *java* then within that file *java project* then hit *next* 
10. give it a project name then hit *finish* then *finish* again then that should be it.
this is very unreliable and has many errors so using the first way is very recommended
