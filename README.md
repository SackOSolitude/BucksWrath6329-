## setting up Eclipse for java or c++ coding-
go [here](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/599681-installing-eclipse-c-java) and follow all of the steps on the website. `ALL OF THEM!!` excluding what your not using that is, for example if your coding with java only do the java steps and if your coding in c++ then only do c++ steps.




### importing Github Projects into Eclipse workspace ---  
##### Easy way -`recommended`-
`Make sure you create a new java project folder in the workspace to import your project into!!!`
1. hit clone/download button on the repository page  and download ZIP file
2. "unzip" or extract file and place somewhere you can remember such as on your desktop 
3. Then open Eclipse and right click within package explorer
4. click on import and open file *general* then use *File System*
5. click on Browse... and find where you put the downloaded file and click on it and hit *Ok*
6. check the white box on the left side of the file name you are importing
7. click *finish* and you're done!
##### second way- clone link- `NOT RECOMMENDED`
1. click Clone/download button on the repository page and a link will pop up, copy that - this is the link as of now: (https://github.com/SackOSolitude/BucksWrath6329-.git)
2. then go into Eclipse and right click on an empty part of the package explore
3. click import
4. left click on the folder *Git* then double click *projects from git*  
5. double click *clone URL*
6. paste the copied URL into the box to the right of *URL:* - the other boxes shall auto fill dont worry!-
7. enter username and password in the bottom part under *Authentication* 
8. Click *finish* 
9. Click file *java* then within that file *java project* then hit *next* 
10. give it a project name then hit *finish* then *finish* again then that should be it.
this is very unreliable and has many errors so using the first way is very recommended



## Dev only Instructions
### Exporting/Uploading to Eclipse ---
1.  go to the repository main code page and to the left of the green Clone/Download button there should be an upload button. click that. or just click [here](https://github.com/SackOSolitude/BucksWrath6329-/upload/master) 
2. now either browse for your file through the file in file explorer and drag into the drop box on the page  or hit *choose your files* and find wanted files in file explorer.
3. `highly reccomend easy way, drag and drop!!!`
