### setting up Eclipse for java or c++ coding-
go [here](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/599681-installing-eclipse-c-java) and follow all of the steps on the website. `ALL OF THEM!!` excluding what your not using that is, for example if your coding with java only do the java steps and if your coding in c++ then only do c++ steps.



### importing Github Projects into Eclipse workspace ---  
##### Easy way -`recommended`-
>Make sure you create a new java project folder in the workspace to import your project into!!!
- Hit clone/download button on the repository page  and download ZIP file looks like--
![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/clone-repo-clone-url-button.png) 
- "unzip" or extract file and place somewhere you can remember such as on your desktop 
- Then open Eclipse and right click within package explorer
- Click on import and open file *general* then use *File System*
- Click on Browse... and find where you put the downloaded file and click on it and hit *Ok*
- Check the white box on the left side of the file name you are importing
- Click *finish* and you're done!
##### second way- clone link- `NOT RECOMMENDED`
- Click Clone/download button on the repository page and a link will pop up, copy that - this is the link as of now: (https://github.com/SackOSolitude/BucksWrath6329-.git)
- Then go into Eclipse and right click on an empty part of the package explore
- Click import
- Left click on the folder *Git* then double click *projects from git*  
- Double click *clone URL*
- Paste the copied URL into the box to the right of *URL:* - the other boxes shall auto fill dont worry!-
- Enter username and password in the bottom part under *Authentication* 
- Click *finish* 
- Click file *java* then within that file *java project* then hit *next* 
- give it a project name then hit *finish* then *finish* again then that should be it.
>This is very unreliable and has many errors so using the first way is very recommended



## Dev only Instructions
### Exporting/Uploading to Eclipse ---
+  Go to the repository main code page and to the left of the green Clone/Download button there should be an upload button. Click that or just click [here](https://github.com/SackOSolitude/BucksWrath6329-/upload/master) 
+ Now either browse for your file through the file in file explorer and drag into the drop box on the page  or hit *choose your files* and find wanted files in file explorer.
> `highly reccomend easy way, drag and drop!!!`




### Changing README.md
-If something needs to change or be added on here then make an edit on the edits branch and what ever needs to be edited use tilde (looks like this ~ and is under Esc key) three times before and after a sentance that needs to be changed and it will put a slash through it. for example: ~~~The cake is a lie~~~ and put the needed change inside () after the sentance such as change to (THE CAKE IS A LIE). if soemthing needs to be added just add it in. anything else you need done you can contact me (devs you know me) and I know all of the steps to change or add anything. whendone jsut hit commit changes and i'll look at it and make changes.
